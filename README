This is **MY** configuration for NeoVim for **Windows**.

It has been pretty much entirely/blatantly stolen from a [Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) YouTube video:
[0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)

There are settings of his that are missing, because I don't use/need those features.
There are also some different keyboard shortcuts used:
* He uses a DVORAK keyboard 
* I use a QWERTY keyboard 
and thus some his shortcuts do not make any sense - for me!

To use this on Windows...
* Install NeoVim from : https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases
* Copy the entire `nvim` directory into `c:\Users\<your_user_account>\AppData\Local\`
  * You should end up with: `c:\Users\<your_user_account>\AppData\Local\nvim\`
  * **Note:** that AppData is normally a HIDDEN directory, you may need to alter your VIEW settings, to see it.

* Run the following command in a Windows Powershell Console
 * git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim-data\site\pack\packer\start\packer.nvim"

* If Neovim is open, shut it down and reopen it.

* Ensure that the `c:\Users\<your_user_account>\AppData\Local\lua\gavin\packer.lua` file is open.
 * (Note You may change the "gavin" directory name to something else - but nonetheless make sure you open the `packer.lua` file.

* Type `:so` : this will "source" the file.

* Type `:PackerSync` : this will install all the plugins.
